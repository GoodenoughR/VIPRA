# Model

[`Model`](modules/model.md) modules are the pedestrian dynamics models that govern how the pedestrians will move during a simulation. 

TODO(tyler): Summary of pedestrian dynamics and how movement is modelled and different parameters required. Examples of different types. Otherwise, this and the other individual modules pages feel pointless and can probably be combined into just Modules.

## Example

For an example of a Model module, see the included [Calm Model module](../base_modules.md#calm-model).
